ConceptArt.frontPageTitle=Concept Art
ConceptArt.description=From the beggining, we known that design would be crucial in Wonsters. We made a lot of \
	drawning before getting to the monsters we all know, some of them made it to the end, but lots of others didn't have the same luck.

ConceptArt.slide.1=Engineers working on game alpha version late in the morning.
ConceptArt.slide.2=One monster farts in the lift, not noticing the sense of smell of his partners.
ConceptArt.slide.3=It doesn't matter if you area monster or a person, to be stronger you must work a lot on the gym.
ConceptArt.slide.4=Even the most horrible beast seems adorable while sleeping, but you must be really crazy to try to wake him up with honking.
ConceptArt.slide.5=Children have fun at school, each one in its own way...
ConceptArt.slide.6=Mushrooms and truffles are the basic feed in Wonsters. Rich in potassium and phosphorus and also low fat.
ConceptArt.slide.7=To be someone on life, you have to study a lot...or being very lucky.
ConceptArt.slide.8=A nice creature has come to world, its protected by GodMonster tentacles..
ConceptArt.slide.9=In Wonsters, monsters get born, but they die to. That's a tragic occupational accident.
ConceptArt.slide.10=Do you want to be a rock star? You will have to practice a lot, and you must enjoy every concert.
ConceptArt.slide.11=Every good worker needs it's own time to have fun. Drink in moderation, it is your responsibility.
ConceptArt.slide.12=To design Wonsters style and races takes a lot of sketches.
ConceptArt.slide.13=Here you can see some discarded drawings. Be careful, one day they can come back to Wonsters world!
ConceptArt.slide.14=On initial art we can see, now with more perspective, those designs there were approaching the game style .
ConceptArt.slide.15=Funny style, nice but drawn fast. That was the objective on characters design.
ConceptArt.slide.16=Some characters design evolution. Final versions were not so easy to draw, but we love them.
ConceptArt.slide.17=Once we decided a style and a methodology to create monsters, we started drawing. First by pencil, and then vectorial.
ConceptArt.slide.18=GodMonster design evolution. It's like a "plant" to give a sense to the idea of being here from the beginning.
ConceptArt.slide.19=GodMonster Wonster style: Organic and black lines, semi-saturated colors, gradients and glows very soft...
ConceptArt.slide.20=Ubunto's final design, the most intelligent race. Hence its arrogant and smug expression, and adult nerd style.
ConceptArt.slide.21=Quad final design, the strongest race. It has a savage expression, but the old one is quiet to show the fact that old ones cannot neither work nor fight.
ConceptArt.slide.22=Electroserpe final design, probably the most dangerous race. Electric snakes and Space invaders texture are signs of its danger.
ConceptArt.slide.23=Drawing Electroserpe on Inkscape. We start from a pencil draw, we give color to it and then texture in vectorial format.
ConceptArt.slide.24=First sketch of user dungeon view. We discarded it in order to use another one more urban and less or a cavern.
ConceptArt.slide.25=One of the first initial concepts for the interface. It's too artistic and not very functional.
ConceptArt.slide.26=Looking for the way of organizing the visual elements. This design is too much functional and not artistic enough for a videogame.
ConceptArt.slide.27=More colorful interface concept. City is upside to show that lairs are underground.
ConceptArt.slide.28=We have the city, windows and almost interface structure. But there are lots of details that must be more profesionally shown.
ConceptArt.slide.29=All the design is done with Gimp, it's not HTML, it's a visual prototype to define interface appearance.
ConceptArt.slide.30=Possible interface. It's artistic, smart and very functional. But it has been discarded because it doesn't gives the user the idea we are looking for.
ConceptArt.slide.31=First prototype with a useful interface shown on a web navigator. I know, it's horrible, but this is just the beginning XD.
ConceptArt.slide.32=Drawing elements on interface with Gimp. From the beginning windows were though to be visualized in different colors.
ConceptArt.slide.33=Artistically draw showing some dungeons on different flats, using the same sprites used on the interface.

Credits.frontPageTitle=Credits
Credits.description=Wonsters is the result of the passion and the work of a little group of friends, who brought Wonsters to life step by step.
Credits.moreInfo=details
Credits.email=Email
Credits.developersTitle=Developers
Credits.technologiesTitle=Tools and Technology
Credits.technologiesDesc=To make Wonsters real we used several technologies and tools.
Credits.gaeDesc=One on the biggest problems we had when we started was to choose a platform. We knew \
	the scalability and location would be a problem, so we decided to deploy Wonsters on the cloud.
Credits.jdoDesc= Chosing GAE as a platform the number of technologies available for data persistence has been greatly reduced \
	We chose JDO instead of JPA because of the transparency in the management of objects.
Credits.springDesc=We rely on the Spring framework and investment control system for configuring components.
Credits.strutsDesc=Wonsters is a Web application, and Struts is a framework widely used and successful. We can \
	isolate the graphics that the user watches of the heart of the game. In addition, Struts is well supported on Google App Engine.
Credits.jQueryDesc=Do more, write less. This is the philosophy of this great JavaScript library that allows us to \
	create a user-friendly interface that works in most browsers and that is easy to maintain by developers.
Credits.junitDesc=Forget about refactoring and last-minute corrections if you have a nice set of unit tests. \
	With jUnit we have endeavored to control the quality and safety of the code throughout the entire development. With this, it gains speed as the project grows.
Credits.bitbucketDesc=Coordination is never easy, and for any development team, large or small, is essential. \
	Version control system, tasks, wiki, messages ... Bibucket allows us to have everything centralized and organized.
Credits.eclipseDesc=Plus it's an excellent IDE for Work Related to Java, we used the <a href="http://code.google.com/eclipse/" target="_blank"> Google plugin for Eclipse </ a> \
	which makes it the ideal tool for developing in GAE with Java.
Credits.othersDesc=One of the strengths of Wonster is its design. <br/> We used Inkscape and GIMP software for drawing and coloring \
	all the monsters of the underground universe of Wonsters.
Credits.thanks=Thanks to
Credits.thanksDesc=In addition to developers, Wonsters has enjoyed the cooperation of many others.<br/><br/> \
	Special thanks to the understanding and support we have received from companies and research groups where we do our jobs. \
	Special mentions to <b>Iago Abal</b> and <b>David Castro</b> for their cooperation and efforts in the early stages of the project. They have provided an interesting perspective of Haskell.<br/><br/> \
	And, of course, thanks to all those who have suffered the consequences of the thousands of hours spent on development. Thanks girlfriends, thanks family and thank you friends.<br/><br/> \
	<b>The merit of the project is also yours</b>

	Since I was a child, this two elements have shaped my life, playing all the videogames I could (thanks mom) and using the \

	These two passions made me, by one way to study the degree course of Computer Engineer to look for opportunities on videogames sector and to cooperate actively on a local radio station in one of the most awarded humor programs. </p><p> \
	When Mario offered me to take part on the project, I didn't even think twice because I knew of its big talent and it was a life opportunity to do what I always wanted.".</p>

		<li><b>Dungeon Rooms</b>: For each dungeon room you get 500 points, and then, 100 points for every level. For example, having the Dormitories at level 3 would be 500 + 3x100 = 800 points.</li>\
		<li>So to get more points, incubate new monster races, build new rooms and upgrade them as high as you can.
